## [Automating Real-World Tasks with Python]

In the final course, I tied together the concepts that I have learned up until now thorugh this course. I tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that challenged me to use multiple skills at once.

First, I explored how to use external Python modules to enhance my code's capabilities. I spent time learning how to use documentation to understand a new module. For example, I used the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. The course material provided simple examples of common tasks, but I needed to delve into the module documentation to solve specific problems.

Next, I learned how to communicate with the world outside of my code. I used data serialization to convert in-memory objects into messages that could be sent to other programs. My program sent messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For situations where my code needed to interact with a person, I also learned to send email messages.

By the end of this course, I was able to take a problem description and use my skills to create a solution, just like in a real-world job. In the final capstone project, I was given a customer's needs and tasked with developing a program to fulfill them.

### What I learned
